# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
Performing analysis on kickstarter data to uncover trends to successfully launch a kickstarter for a play in the US.
## Findings/Results
The best time to launch a kickstarter campaign is the month of May. !outcomesbasedonlaunchdate.png(path/to/outcomesbasedonlaunchdate.png)

# Recommendations
I would recommend Louise start her kickstarter sometime in May in the US where donors are more likely to ensure her kickstarters success based on the data. With a goal of $12,000.00 Louise should still reach her goal in the US during the time of May for a successful kickstarter.
